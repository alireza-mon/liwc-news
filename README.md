This repository contains the code associated with the ICWSM 2025 paper:

> **Successful Rhetorics: How Do Linguistic Dimensions Affect User Engagement with Different News Categories on Twitter?**  
> *Alireza Mohammadinodooshan and Niklas Carlsson*  
> In *Proceedings of the International Conference on Web and Social Media (ICWSM)*, 2025.

## Overview

The code in this repository is designed to analyze the linguistic dimensions of tweets published by various news publishers and their relationship to user engagement rate on X (formerly Twitter).

To run the analyses, you will need access to a list of tweets from various publishers, stored under: `data/publisher_tweets/`

In case you to do not have these lists and according to recent limitations imposed by X on the public sharing of tweet IDs, we are unable to share this data directly in the repository.

If you do not already have access to the tweet ID list, please contact us at:

ðŸ“Œ Please use the subject line: `ICWSM25_liwc_news`

We will provide you with the necessary data upon request.

## Supplementary LIWC Dimensions

In addition to the four LIWC dimensions analyzed in the main study ("Analytic", "Clout", "Perception", and "Risk"), we also computed results for other LIWC dimensions. These supplementary results are provided in the folder [`./figs/box_plots`] for completeness and potential future reference.
